In the responses to our recent survey, one request came up again and again.

Publishers wanted a way to let teachers add their own courses themselves.

We thought that was <strong>a great idea</strong>. (In fact, it was something we&rsquo;d already started work on even before we&rsquo;d sent out the survey.)

So we made it happen in this version of <a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com" target="_blank">Guru</a>.
<h2>The Guru Front-End Teacher Interface Is Here!</h2>
Your teachers can now prepare whole courses themselves, letting you collect either a percentage of the sales or a set fee. It&rsquo;s up to you.

<img alt="" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/f5f91112-05df-45e7-a3b2-52bde4ae4cb1.jpg" width="600" height="450" align="none" />
<h2>Teacher Registration Is Easy</h2>
Your teachers can register quickly, receive your approval, then start working on their courses right away. You will be notified when a new teacher requires your approval.
<h2>Review, Publish, You&rsquo;re Done!</h2>
When teachers can prepare their courses without the help of the site&rsquo;s admin, all you need to do is review the course and publish. You&rsquo;ll have all the time you need to promote the course, bring in students and make money!

<img alt="" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/5a2384cb-d94c-4fff-a81e-a884b5d4c6ce.jpg" width="600" height="347" align="none" />
<h2>Teachers Can Create New Quizzes And Add Media</h2>
To build a really comprehensive course, teachers will need to be able to add quizzes and media. Teachers can do that by embedding media, linking to it or uploading it directly to your server.

<img alt="" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/cfdd50b9-2ce4-442d-aaff-35e2e769c1ea.png" width="600" height="339" align="none" />
<h2>Stats About Students</h2>
The teachers&rsquo; interface also gives teachers stats about their students and full access to quiz results. They can see how well students are doing and receive detailed information that shows which students succeeded where — and where they need to work harder.

<img alt="" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/c86fbf4f-3521-497c-bb75-dbb53c7ceb73.jpg" width="600" height="360" align="none" />
<h2>Mass Video Import And Automatic Lesson Generation</h2>
Another very useful new feature is the ability to import whole playlists from YouTube or entire albums from Vimeo. Each video will automatically generate a lesson placed in the module of a selected course. Video titles and descriptions are fetched automatically. This powerful feature will save you hours of work! Read more about this feature <a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com/easyblog/entry/mass-import-lessons/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>Additional Features In Version 3.2.0</h2>
In addition to the new teacher&rsquo;s interface, we&rsquo;ve included other improvements to Guru:
<h3>Quizzes Pagination</h3>
Got a big quiz with 100 questions? Spread them over a couple of pages.

<img alt="" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/a8f1fcf1-52e7-42ae-9a62-a08557cd0f37.png" width="501" height="220" align="none" />
<h3>Automatic Fetching of Video Content</h3>
When you add videos from any of the supported video hosts, you are now able to fetch the video&rsquo;s title, thumbnail and description easily. You can read more about it <a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com/easyblog/entry/mass-import-lessons/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>More Information About Orders</h3>
See which course was purchased on the backend &ldquo;orders&rdquo; page.

<img alt="" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/8a851391-b2fc-4bf0-9962-d23e8ce5939d.png" width="550" height="206" align="none" />
<h3>Organize Lessons Alphabetically</h3>
A single click brings order to your lessons.
<h3>Change Lesson Access Easily</h3>
Change access to lessons in a few clicks instead of editing every lesson individually.

<img alt="" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/3fc2b528-f703-43e0-9a3d-c737ea5d3184.png" width="572" height="282" align="none" />
<h3>Terms And Conditions For Teacher And Student Registration Process</h3>
Use different T&amp;C forms for teachers and students.

Creating a great video course isn&rsquo;t easy. You have to really dedicate yourself to producing content that will not only convey knowledge but also interest students. And once you&rsquo;ve produced those videos, you have to add them to <a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com/" target="_blank">Guru</a>. That&rsquo;s work.
<h2>Import Multiple Lessons At Once</h2>
Adding just a few video lessons to Guru is easy. Adding fifty or a hundred videos one-by-one can be strenuous.

Not anymore!
<p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/f6b2ef72-efe4-4299-a633-99e1125a74b8.png" width="600" height="333" align="none" /></p>
Now you can mass import your video lessons from <a href="http://vimeo.com/" target="_blank">Vimeo</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. It&rsquo;s super-easy and fetches not just the videos but also their thumbnails, titles and descriptions.
<h2>Here&rsquo;s How It Works:</h2>
<h2>1. Prepare Guru for your videos.</h2>
First, make sure you have a course with at least one module. You should also have a media category in which to place the video, and if you&rsquo;re not the teacher, you&rsquo;ll need to add him or her to your list so that you can set them as the creator of the course.

Imported videos cannot be private so set the videos to &lsquo;<strong>public</strong>&lsquo; until you have finished adding them. You can change the privacy settings when you&rsquo;re done.
<h2>2. Add the videos</h2>
The process differs for YouTube and Vimeo, but it&rsquo;s always quick. Expect to lose… ooh, about a minute doing this.
<h3>YouTube Mass Import</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to Guru&rsquo;s backend &gt; Media &gt; Add Mass Videos.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/55534684-2061-4b66-ba06-872961ed8294.png" width="189" height="203" align="none" /></p></li>
<li><p>Pick YouTube as the provider and take the playlist ID from the playlist URL.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/86d8ef07-29f3-4f0b-b443-973ea20e0382.png" width="523" height="34" align="none" /></p></li>
<li><p>You can pick the number of videos to show per page and set the video that starts the course.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/7779eee5-e665-43c0-84b9-0a36c6c73f7f.png" width="600" height="71" align="none" /></p></li>
<li><p>Select the Media category to place the videos.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/a3fe0ca8-5811-4663-aba2-91381708fdfb.png" width="412" height="37" align="none" /></p></li>
<li><p>Select the lesson and lesson module to place the videos.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/8e252fc4-cf72-4678-8076-f978eeaa2906.png" width="600" height="44" align="none" /></p></li>
<li><p>Set the teacher for the course and the lesson access.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/25b88100-9866-452f-a291-dff10fe46490.png" width="478" height="45" align="none" /></p><p></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, click the checkboxes on the left to choose any videos you don&rsquo;t want to import, and click &lsquo;Fetch Videos.&rsquo;</p><p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/831ecb53-b0e4-423d-b584-a78562b50c3b.png" width="600" height="332" align="none" /></p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Vimeo Mass Import</h3>
<p>Vimeo uses albums instead of playlists, so you&rsquo;ll need an album ID.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/3f40d38d-69f6-4f39-97fa-ef9277b0fb42.png" width="286" height="32" align="none" /></p>

You can also select the page from which you wish to import your videos. The rest of the process is exactly the same as for YouTube.

This is what the course looks like when you import 50 or more lessons. You&rsquo;ll have saved hours and you can now divide them into modules if you want.
<h2>Guru Is Growing</h2>
This is just one feature that we created based on your feedback to make Guru even more powerful and user-friendly. We always keep usability in mind and you can expect more great improvements soon.

We&rsquo;ve just released a new version of our <strong>iJoomla Installer</strong>. This version introduces a few improvements and offers support for all our commercial extensions.

<hr />

<h2>What is iJoomla Installer?</h2>
iJoomla Installer is a Joomla component that lets you easily install or upgrade any of the iJoomla extensions for which you bought a license. This new version supports all of our commercial extensions, including:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://jomsocial.com" target="_blank">JomSocial</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com">Guru Pro</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://adagency.ijoomla.com">Ad Agency Pro</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://seo.ijoomla.com">iSEO Pro</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://publisher.ijoomla.com">Publisher Pro</a></li>
</ul>
<div><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/c40334dd-76e5-446e-951e-09d5d8a85bb9.png" width="600" height="404" align="none" /></div>
<h2>Why Use iJoomla Installer?</h2>
<strong>It&rsquo;s easy!</strong> iJoomla Installer will help you to install any of your purchased extensions — and will also let you <strong>upgrade to the latest version</strong> in just one click. You won&rsquo;t need to log in or go our site to download and re-install.
<h2>How It Works</h2>
When you purchase any of our extensions on either iJoomla.com or JomSocial.com, you will be asked to enter the domain names on which you plan to install the extension. Type in the domains, separated by a comma, then click the &ldquo;<strong>Update</strong>&rdquo; button.
<p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/d4d08fcf-aa75-4c93-ab13-72f33250d62f.jpg" width="600" height="398" align="none" /></p>
Make sure that you also enter any sub-domains. So if your main domain were &ldquo;domain.com&rdquo; and you want to install the extension on &ldquo;test.domain.com,&rdquo; your list of domains would look like this:

<strong>domain.com,test.domain.com</strong>

The installer will now be able to confirm that you have a valid license.

You will also find an installer when you download the package. Install it, then click the blue &ldquo;<strong>Install</strong>&rdquo; button. As long as you have an active license associated with the domain or sub-domain on which you&rsquo;re installing the extension, you&rsquo;re done!
<p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/7b1bc726-741d-4d0f-99cb-e5b80a224fd2.jpg" width="600" height="298" align="none" /></p>

<h2>Upgrade Your Extensions With iJoomla Installer</h2>
Whenever we release a new version of an extension, you&rsquo;ll see a notification on the back end. It will either appear next to the logo or in the notification area.

Check the changelog to learn more about the upgrade then go to <strong>components &gt; iJoomla Installer</strong> and click the &ldquo;<strong>Upgrade</strong>&rdquo; button.
<p><img alt="" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/7c68e66a0a1710bce433acfc3/images/b76f49b4-f3bc-491d-94f9-29bd47c0bbd1.jpg" width="600" height="395" align="none" /></p>

If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to get your hands on <a href="http://jomsocial.com" target="_blank">JomSocial</a> &ndash; the hottest social networking app for Joomla — but didn&rsquo;t have the cash, you now have a great opportunity. Those Bitcoins sitting around in your wallet can become a thriving online community.
<h2>How to buy our Joomla extensions with Bitcoin:</h2>

Just check out as normal, and choose &ldquo;Bitcoin&rdquo; as the payment method. On the next page you will see the Bitcoin amount and the QR code. Scan the code or copy and paste the address. Once the payment is approved, you&rsquo;ll be automatically taken to the &ldquo;My Downloads” page to download your product.

iJoomla has been around since 2005. Since then we’ve released more than 20 different extensions and served many thousands of satisfied customers.

<span></span>

We’ve learned a lot in that time but we’re always learning more, adapting to the market and adjusting to our customers’ needs. Now we feel it’s time to make some big changes that will take us to the next level.

<h2>iJoomla goes Light</h2>

Many people have asked us over the years whether our products have a ‘trial version.’ Until now, the answer was… “no.” No longer.

Now, we do have Light versions and they’re not trial versions. They’re actual, useful products that you can use as long as you want. They never expire.
<h2>So what’s a Light version?</h2>
A Light version of an iJoomla product has fewer features and some limitations. For example, Guru Light restricts the number of courses you can create; Publisher Light restricts the number of issues you can create. Most of the features though are usable, enjoyable and in place.
<h2>Light versions are FREE</h2>
You can download any of our Light versions for free. There’s no commitment so you can try them out, use them, play with them and enjoy them. If the Light version is enough for your needs, that’s great. If you find you need a Pro version, you can always upgrade later.
<h4>Which products have a Light version?</h4>
Light versions are available for:
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com" target="_blank">Guru</a></strong> (<a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Compare Light and Pro versions</a>)</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://seo.ijoomla.com">iSEO</a></strong> (<a href="http://seo.ijoomla.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Compare Light and Pro versions</a>)</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://adagency.ijoomla.com/" target="_blank">Ad Agency</a></strong> (<a href="http://adagency.ijoomla.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Compare Light and Pro versions</a>)</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://publisher.ijoomla.com/" target="new">Publisher</a></strong> (<a href="http://publisher.ijoomla.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Compare Light and Pro versions</a>)</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.ijoomla.com/free-downloads/products/347/" target="_blank">You can download the Light versions here</a> or <a href="http://www.ijoomla.com/store/products/47-joomla-extensions/443/" target="_blank">buy the pro versions here</a>.
<h2>Why doesn’t JomSocial have a Light version?</h2>
<a href="http://www.jomsocial.com/" target="_blank">JomSocial</a> is the most complex of all of our extensions, and at the moment we’re focused on developing version 3.3. We aren’t working on a Light version of JomSocial for now but we might create one in the future.
<h2>iJoomla Surveys and iJoomla SideBars go FREE!</h2>
We loved working on iJoomla Surveys and iJoomla SideBars but it’s time to let them go. We’d rather focus our time and effort on developing our bigger and more complex extensions. We won’t be developing them further for Joomla 3. People who use Joomla 2.5 can now <a href="http://www.ijoomla.com/free-downloads/products/347/">enjoy them for free</a>.
<h2>Tight integration with JomSocial</h2>
<a href="http://www.jomsocial.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="JomSocial" src="http://www.ijoomla.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JomSocial-black-01.png" width="386" height="122" /></a>

Since <a href="http://www.jomsocial.com/" target="_blank">JomSocial</a> is our most popular product and has such amazing integration capabilities, we’re going to be integrating it with all our products.

This is a process that we started even before taking over the JomSocial product but having all the extensions under one roof will make the integration so much easier!
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com" target="_blank">Guru</a></strong> – We have already<a href="http://guru.ijoomla.com/easyblog/entry/jomsocial-guru-integration-4-plugins-available/" target="_blank"> released four plugins</a>, and a tighter integration is coming soon. You can read more about it here.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://seo.ijoomla.com">iSEO</a></strong> &ndash; Full integration is already in place! <a href="http://seo.ijoomla.com/blog/entry/iseo-makeover-jomsocial/" target="_blank">Read all about it</a>.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://adagency.ijoomla.com/" target="_blank">Ad Agency</a></strong> – We’ve been <a href="http://adagency.ijoomla.com/social-targeting/" target="_blank">offering advertisers and admins the ability to target ads by social profiles</a> for the last few years. It works great. (Check it out.) But we think we can do more. We’re now pushing for an even tighter integration that will allow the ads to behave like those on Facebook. Work on this should begin in a few weeks.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://publisher.ijoomla.com/" target="new">Publisher</a></strong> &ndash; A few awesome JomSocial plugins are almost ready.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Standardized admin and front end</h2>

<p><img alt="Ad Agency Dashboard" src="http://www.ijoomla.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dashboard.png" width="681" height="241" /></p>

All our products now have the same beautiful admin interface. It really is the nicest design in the Joomla world: super user-friendly and easy on the eyes. It’s great.

All our products (except for JomSocial) also have the same front-end design with the same style and the same toolbar. That consistency is helpful when you combine more than one of our products.
<h2>Focus, commitment, reliability</h2>
Our aim with all these changes it to reach out to a lot more users who never had the opportunity to experience our products. We also want to focus our efforts on our most important products and make them as good as they can be.

It’s been eight years since our Joomla product, iJoomla Magazine, was launched but it feels like we’re just getting started! Let’s make this the best year ever for iJoomla and our customers.";s:11:"description";s:344:"iJoomla has been around since 2005.

<h2>Powered by Bootstrap</h2>
The entire front and back-ends are now powered by Bootstrap. They’re attractive, they’re flexible, they look great, and they just work. Perfect.
<h2>New &amp; Responsive design</h2>
And because the front end is powered by Bootstrap, it’s now completely responsive. Both the issues and the author interface have been redesigned so that they work beautifully on every device in every size. The entire CSS has been optimized to be light and tight as possible.

<h2><a href="http://www.ijoomla.com/component/digistore/products/68-free-joomla-extensions/181-publisher-light/189?Itemid=189"></a>What’s In This Light Version?</h2>

Most of the features on Publisher Pro are available on Publisher Light but some, such as the number of issues and styles, are limited.

The main feature missing from Publisher Light is the ability for authors to sign up on the front end and submit articles.

<h2>Try it today &ndash; FREE!</h2>
You can <a href="http://www.ijoomla.com/component/digistore/products/68-free-joomla-extensions/181-publisher-light/189?Itemid=189" target="_blank">download Publisher Light for FREE today.</a>

You’ll be able to create an issue, add zones, create styles, build media galleries and more. If you ever wanted to try Publisher, now’s your chance to put it through its paces without spending a dime. Enjoy yourself!
<h2>Publisher 3 — An Amazing New Development</h2>
Publisher is one of the best products we’ve created. It’s packed with some amazing features, many of which we created in response to feedback from customers like you.

It’s been eight years since new launched iJoomla Magazine. That’s eight years of gathering experience, listening to customers and producing what really has to be the perfect publishing platform for Joomla.

<h2>Multilingual support</h2>
Ready to publish your news or magazines in more than one language? Publisher makes it easy.

Not only are publishers reliant on Google’s algorithms to deliver ads that suit their visitors, their designs to attract clicks and their inventory to find advertisers, but they’re also giving up 32 percent of the value of their website real estate. Google only shares 68 percent of the advertising sales price with its publishers.

The alternative is to build your own<a href="http://adagency.ijoomla.com/" target="_blank"> advertising program with Joomla</a>.

It’s not as hard as you think — and it can be a great deal more lucrative than you imagine.

Here are 10 tips that will help you to create a successful advertising program with Joomla.
<h2>1. Create a WorkFlow</h2>
Your first step will be to create a workflow and a financial outline of the service your site will offer. <strong>You’ll need to know every step the advertiser might take and every scenario that could unfold as a result of taking that step.</strong>

The workflow should be built around a “perfect system,” the simplest route from reading about the offers to choosing a package, uploading the ads and purchasing the campaign. But it should also include the ways in which the advertiser could request technical help or pull down a report. You’ll want to be ready.
<h2>2. Plan the Sale</h2>
The workflow lets you plan the offer but sellers also need to know exactly what they’re offering. Before starting to offer advertising, you’ll need to know:
<ul>
	<li>The amount of <strong>advertising inventory</strong> you can comfortably handle;</li>
	<li>The number of <strong>impressions</strong> you can deliver for that inventory;</li>
	<li>How you can increase impressions for that inventory over set periods;</li>
	<li>And the average <strong>industry pricing</strong> for the models you’ll be using.</li>
</ul>
While it may be possible to increase inventory broadly, each expansion may carry extra costs involved in collecting the inventory and managing it.
<h2>3. Know How You’ll Manage the Program</h2>

Ideally, an advertising program will be entirely hands-off. Advertisers will be able to choose a package and submit their ads, and you won’t need to do any more than approve the campaign and send a reminder when it’s up for renewal — and sometimes, not even that.

In practice though, each advertiser may need an account rep to work with them. You will need to be available to answer questions both before the sale and afterwards, and you’ll need to draw up a plan and a script to handle each of the most important aspects of the site/advertiser relationship.

You should know how you plan to manage marketing outreach, client contact, sales follow-up and even customer service surveys.

It’s not a lot of work but you should know what to expect.
<h2>4. Build Your Tech Support</h2>
Tech support shouldn’t just be an option for troubleshooting; it should be a sales point that reassures potential clients that they’ll never need to struggle. The support might consist of live chat, a FAQ section, a forum/knowledge base, direct support e-mail or a support ticket system.

The more types of help you can offer clients, the better, but bear in mind that each option will take a different amount of time and require a different level of investment.
<h2>5. Offer Targeting</h2>
<div><img alt="The better you can target your ads, the more you can charge for them" src="http://www.ijoomla.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/adverting-targeting-202x300.jpg" width="202" height="300" /><p>The better you can target your ads, the more you can charge for them</p></div>

The better you can target your ads, the more you can charge for them. Smart advertising programs can offer a choice of three different kinds of targeting:
<h3><a href="http://www.ijoomla.com/blog/feed/rss/&lt;p&gt;10 Top Tips for Creating a Successful Advertising Program with Joomla!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;" target="_blank">Geo-Targeting</a></h3>
Geo-targeting allows advertisers to display ads based on the geographic area of the viewer. They help to ensure that their ads are local, their products are reachable and the ad appears in the reader’s language. So the owner of a pizza restaurant could be sure that his ads are only being seen in the areas to which he delivers, and a fashion designer could show her ads in French, Italian or English depending on where her buyers are viewing the page.

Geo-targeting should be a basic feature of the advertising program you offer.
<h3><a href="http://adagency.ijoomla.com/social-targeting/" target="_blank">Social Targeting </a></h3>
Social targeting lets advertisers target their ads according to demographic data such as age, gender or education — or a mixture of that data. So a wedding planner could make sure that her ads were only seen by women aged 30-plus with college degrees.

Combine social targeting with geo-targeting and you’re already on your way to a powerful advertising program.
<h3><a href="http://adagency.ijoomla.com/keyword-targeting/" target="_blank">Keyword Targeting </a></h3>
Keyword targeting returns ads based on the advertiser’s or the website admin’s chosen keywords. It’s a valuable, accurate way to make sure that ads are shown on appropriate pages. You’ll just need to make sure that your keyword metatags are set up properly.
<h2>6. Offer a Free Package</h2>
Letting your advertisers try your program before they commit can greatly increase your conversion rate. Advertisers want to see their return before they spend their cash. Limiting the number of impressions your advertisers receive, for example, will show them exactly what you can deliver without either of you having to give too much away.

However you choose to do it, let advertisers know about your free package. Encourage them to upload their banners and ads while they’re trying it out so that they can see exactly how it works and what they can get from it. The more engaged they are, the more likely they are to buy.
<h2>7. Don’t Hide Your Advertising Program on Your Site – Promote It!</h2>
<div><img alt="Don’t Hide Your Advertising Program on Your Site – Promote It!" src="http://www.ijoomla.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/advertise-here.fw_-300x200.png" width="300" height="200" /><p>Don’t Hide Your Advertising Program on Your Site – Promote It!</p></div>

A common mistake made by publishers is to hide the advertising link in some out-of-the-way corner of the site, as though advertising were something to be ashamed of. It isn’t. Make your advertising opportunities clear.

Place a big “Advertise on this site” link above the fold and keep the “Advertise here” link in as many of your zones as possible.
<h2>8. Invest Time in Your “Overview Page”</h2>
The Overview page is where you get to sell your advertising program. Include graphs about your traffic, add testimonials, provide details about your demographics, and more.

Don’t be afraid to market your site. You built that data, now sell it!
<h2>9. Offer Promo Codes</h2>
<div><img alt="Promo codes can be a very effective way to convince doubters to buy your advertising program" src="http://www.ijoomla.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/promo-code-300x232.jpg" width="300" height="232" /><p>Promo codes can be a very effective way to convince doubters to buy your advertising program</p></div>

. Send a code in an email, announce it in your newsletter or share it on social media and watch your orders rocket.

That’s especially true when you limit the code to 72 hours and keep the code simple. Any more than eight characters and people start to mis-type it.
<h2>10. Take Recurring Payments</h2>
When a campaign ends, you don’t want to give the advertiser a chance to think again. If you’re using PayPal, you can set the campaign to renew automatically.

The advertisers keep their traffic, and you keep your revenue!

If all that sounds complicated, you can relax. Joomla users have a simple solution. iJoomla’s Ad Agency has all the features we’ve described here. From targeting to free trials and from promo codes to recurring payments, you’ll be in complete control of your advertising program.
<h2>You’ll also be able to:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use zones to place ads in any module position;</li>
	<li>Choose to display ads vertically or horizontally;</li>
	<li>Create packages based on CPM, CPC or time limits;</li>
	<li>Create inventory zones;</li>
	<li>And even rotate banners to increase clicks and views.</li>
