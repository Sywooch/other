                    <p>My name is Anna Chernykh and I'm glad to welcome you to my author's accessories. All the
                        accessories on our website, conceived and developed by me. We make it as we are, and that I have
                        helped a few people, mostly family members.</p>

                    <p>We live and work in a small Ural city of Kungur, in the Perm region. Quiet, cozy and quiet. We
                        have preserved a large number of old houses, churches and shops. A lot of greens, a unique
                        Kungur Ice Cave, Belogorsk Monastery, rivers Sylva and Iren - that's only part of the landmarks
                        of my homeland. In June we held an interesting Festival of Ballooning - "Sky Fair". Twenty
                        balloons soaring into the sunset sky - a beautiful sight! Will we in the margins - write, invite
                        you to visit us on a tour of the studio, you try to do something with their rukami- will be a
                        great souvenir</p>
                    <p>I've been doing jewelry business almost my entire adult life. My dad once started to make jewelry
                        from German silver, nickel silver, and then, when the opportunity arose, of silver. Now it's my
                        life. In addition to the hardware I do and ready to decorate, using silver, brass, bronze and
                        glass in the technique of "lampwork". Now we work together, the whole family - my husband, my
                        mother, my aunt. I hope my children when they grow up, will also help us.
                    </p>
                    <p>The idea to make accessories for masters, creating decorations, appeared in 2009. Since then, I
                        have created 30 collections and accessories are used in various fields of art - puppet fact,
                        work with leather, creating clothes, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p> I create accessories for the collections, they are usually grouped stylistically, such as
                        "steampunk" or "Knights of Time". Or functional - "Beads for bracelets Regaliz". In each
                        collection you will find any type of item to create jewelry - beads cap, lock-toggl, suspension,
                        the central element. This approach allows the author does not suffer with the selection of
                        accessories - just select all the items of a collection and they will be combined with each
                        other. And, of course, no one does not limit you in the works - at your service any of the more
                        than 4,000 items.
                    </p>
                    <p> Another important difference between my accessories - the possibility of its modification. Since
                        I use for the production of bronze and brass (plating is used only in antique silver color),
                        this makes it possible to cover the fittings patina, saw her, bending, soldering, polishing and
                        so on. For your beaded necklaces you need a special color is a central element? Easily! You can
                        even choose the tone you want to use :) These ducts as limit switches, but the diameter is not
                        quite appropriate? Hammer in your hands! We are almost co-authors in this case :)
                    </p>
                    <p> And yet - just a huge selection of accessories. We need a similar, but smaller - almost
                        certainly find. In addition, the new collections are released regularly. I'm sure - sure to find
                        something suitable to you.
                    </p>
                    <p> Enjoy your creativity,
                    </p>
