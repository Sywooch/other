         My name is Anna Chernykh
        and I glad to meet you on website dedicated to my jewelry findings. All findings provided on the site, was
        invented and developed by me. We make it as we are, and there are few peoples help me in that, mostly of they is
        family members.
    </p>
    <p>We live and work in Russia, in a small town Kungur in Ural mountains. It is quiet,
        cozy and beautiful town. We have preserved a large number of old houses, churches and shops. Lots of greenery, a
        unique Kungur Ice Cave, Belogorsky Monastery, rivers Sylva and Iren - that's just some of the landmarks of my
        homeland. Every year in June, we held a Festival of Ballooning - &quot;Heavenly Fair&quot;. Twenty of floating
        balloons in the sunset sky - a beautiful sight! If you're ever in our town - write me and I invite you to my
        home and workshop. You will try to do something by your own hands - that`s would be great souvenir:)</p>

    <p>I've been doing jewelry almost all of my adult life. My dad once started to make
        jewelry out of German silver, nickel silver, and then, when the opportunity arose, of silver. Now it's my life
        too. In addition to the findings I make jewelry with silver, brass, bronze and glass in lampwork technique. Now
        we are working together with the whole family - my husband, my mother, my aunt. Hopefully, my children will help
        us when they grow up.
    </p>

    <p>
        The idea to making findings appeared in 2009. Since then, I have created 30
        collections and my findings are used in different areas of art - puppet making, leather working, clothes, and
        jewelry making of course. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I create findings by collections, usually they are united stylistically, like <a
            href="http://annabronze.com/en/catalog/steampunk/" target="_blank">&quot;Steampunk&quot;</a> or <a
            href="http://annabronze.com/en/catalog/time_of_knights/" target="_blank">&quot;Time of knights&quot;</a>. Or
        functionally - <a href="http://annabronze.com/en/catalog/businy_dlya_brasletov_regaliz6036/" target="_blank">
            &quot;Regaliz elements&quot;</a>. In each collection you will find any type of findings to create jewelry -
        bead caps, toggle clasps, pendants, focal elements. This approach allows the author does not suffer from the
        selection of findings - just select all the items from one collection and they will be combined with each other.
        And, of course, no one does not limit you - at your service any of the more than 4,000 items.
    </p>

    <p>
        An important difference of my findings - is the possibility of
        modification. Because i use for making findings true metals - brass and bronze (except antique silver - this one
        is silver-plated brass), this makes possible to patina, sawing, bending, soldering, polishing and so on. For
        your beaded necklace you need a special color central element? It`s easy! You can even choose tone:) Do you want
        to use this tubes as a end caps, but it is not right size? Take a hammer and change it! We are almost
        collaborators in this case :)
    </p>

    <p>
        And more - just a huge selection of findings. Need the same, but less - almost
        certainly find. In addition, new collections are published regularly. I'm sure - you can find something suitable
        to you.
    </p>

    <p>Enjoy your creativity,</p>

    <p>Anna Chernykh</p>
